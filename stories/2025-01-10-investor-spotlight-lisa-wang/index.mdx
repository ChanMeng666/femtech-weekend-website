# Why I Bet Big on Women's Health: Lisa Wang's Investment Philosophy

*Lisa Wang, Partner at Horizon Ventures and one of Asia's most active FemTech investors, shares her perspective on why women's health is the next frontier in healthcare investing.*

## A Different Kind of Investor

Lisa Wang wasn't always focused on women's health. With a background in traditional healthcare venture capital, she spent the first decade of her career investing in biotech and medical devices. But a personal experience changed everything.

"I went through a difficult pregnancy in my late 30s," Lisa shares candidly. "I had access to the best doctors, the best hospitals—and yet I felt like the healthcare system wasn't designed for me. That's when I realized: this is a massive market failure."

## The Investment Thesis

Since pivoting her focus to FemTech in 2019, Lisa has led investments in over 15 women's health companies across Asia. Her investment thesis is straightforward:

> "Women control 80% of household healthcare decisions. Yet less than 4% of healthcare R&D funding goes to women-specific conditions. That's not just an injustice—it's a market opportunity."

### What Lisa Looks For

When evaluating FemTech startups, Lisa focuses on three key criteria:

1. **Scientific rigor**: "I want to see founders who understand the underlying biology, not just the user interface."

2. **Market timing**: "Is the regulatory environment ready? Is consumer awareness there? Timing matters enormously in healthcare."

3. **Team resilience**: "Women's health is hard. You need founders who can weather the skepticism and keep building."

## Portfolio Highlights

Lisa's portfolio spans the full spectrum of women's health:

| Company | Focus Area | Stage |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| FertilityAI | Fertility optimization | Series A |
| MenoTech | Menopause management | Seed |
| PelvicHealth | Pelvic floor therapy | Series B |
| MamaWell | Maternal mental health | Series A |

## The China Opportunity

Lisa is particularly bullish on the Chinese market. "China has 700 million women, a rapidly aging population, and a government that's actively encouraging birth rates. The policy tailwinds are incredible."

She also notes the unique cultural factors at play: "Chinese women are digital-first. They're comfortable with health apps, telemedicine, and sharing data. That creates opportunities that don't exist in other markets."

## Advice for Founders Seeking Investment

For entrepreneurs looking to raise capital for their FemTech ventures, Lisa offers practical guidance:

- **Lead with data**: "Show me the clinical evidence. Show me the user retention. Numbers speak louder than narratives."
- **Think global**: "Build for China, but design for scale. The best FemTech companies will be cross-border."
- **Be patient with investors**: "Many VCs are still learning about women's health. Educate us. We want to invest—we just need to understand."

## Looking Ahead

Lisa predicts that 2025 will be a breakthrough year for FemTech in Asia. "We're going to see the first wave of exits—IPOs, acquisitions. That will bring more capital into the space and create a virtuous cycle."

When asked about her long-term vision, Lisa is clear: "I want to live in a world where investing in women's health is not 'impact investing' or 'niche investing'—it's just smart investing."
