## 48 Hours to Transform Women's Health

Get ready for the most exciting women's health tech event of the year! FemTech Weekend is thrilled to announce our **2025 FemTech Hackathon** - a 48-hour innovation sprint where developers, designers, healthcare professionals, and entrepreneurs come together to build groundbreaking solutions for women's health challenges.

As a full-stack developer who's passionate about using technology to drive meaningful change, I've experienced firsthand how hackathons can spark innovation and create connections that last well beyond the event itself. The FemTech Hackathon offers a unique opportunity to:

## Why FemTech Matters

At FemTech Weekend, we believe in amplifying women in tech entrepreneurship and creating an inclusive ecosystem where women from China can access the knowledge, capital, and support needed to succeed in the health innovation space.

The statistics speak for themselves:
- Women make up half the population but have historically been underserved by healthcare research and technology
- According to our research, approximately 15-25% of new mothers in China experience postpartum depression
- Around 40% of Chinese women suffer from various degrees of reproductive tract infections and gynecological diseases

By bringing together diverse perspectives and technical expertise, we can address these challenges and create solutions that truly make a difference.

> "Innovation happens at the intersection of diverse disciplines. Our hackathon brings together people with different skills and backgrounds to tackle some of the most pressing women's health challenges." - Leaf He, Chief Operating Officer at FemTech Weekend
