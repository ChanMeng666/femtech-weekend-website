# 2025 Global FemTech Investment Landscape Review

In 2025, the global FemTech (women's health technology) sector has witnessed a surge in investment and financing activities: international giants engaging in M&A, specialized funds entering the market; domestic policy support intensifying, and local technology breakthroughs, all together painting a new development landscape for the industry.

This time, we've conducted a comprehensive two-way analysis between Western countries and China, compiling and reviewing 50+ major transactions in the global FemTech sector (including domestic) in 2025, and deconstructing the underlying logic of capital preferences and sector structure.

## The Patterns We're Seeing:

**Capital focus is shifting from "consumer-oriented/narrative-driven" to "serious healthcare"** (oncology, diagnostics, chronic disease management, etc.);

At the same time, **women's health needs are being more comprehensively integrated into a "full lifecycle" framework** (from fertility to menopause and senior health);

**Driven by policy and domestic substitution**, sectors such as assisted reproduction, HPV-related technologies, women's oncology, and postpartum rehabilitation are accelerating in China.

As China's first investment consulting platform focused on the women's health technology sector, FemTech Weekend hopes to provide the industry with a clearer "capital map" through this *2025 Investment Landscape Review*.
