## Connecting Academia, Industry, and Innovation

FemTech Weekend is proud to announce our first **FemTech Research Symposium**, a landmark event bringing together leading researchers, clinicians, technologists, and entrepreneurs to explore the frontiers of women's health science and innovation.

## Why a Research Focus?

As the technology ecosystem for women's health continues to grow, we recognize the crucial importance of building solutions grounded in rigorous scientific research. Our symposium aims to strengthen the connections between academic research and practical applications, fostering collaborations that can transform women's healthcare.

From my perspective as a developer working at the intersection of technology and healthcare, I've seen how vital it is to have strong research foundations for any health tech solution. This symposium represents an important step in building those foundations within China's FemTech community.

## Symposium Themes

This year's symposium will focus on several critical research areas:

1. **Advances in Reproductive Health Research**: Latest findings in fertility, pregnancy monitoring, and reproductive aging
2. **Mental Health Science**: Research on women's psychological wellbeing across different life stages
3. **Preventative Care Innovations**: New approaches to early detection and prevention of women's health conditions
4. **Digital Biomarkers**: Novel methods for tracking and analyzing women's health indicators
5. **AI and Data Science in Women's Health**: Applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning in diagnosing and treating women's health conditions

## Distinguished Speakers

Our symposium features an impressive lineup of speakers from prestigious institutions:

- **Professor Lin Mei**, Beijing University Medical School - "Emerging Trends in Women's Reproductive Health Research"
- **Dr. Sarah Johnson**, Stanford University - "Digital Biomarkers for Women's Health Monitoring"
- **Dr. Zhang Wei**, Fudan University - "AI Applications in Early Detection of Gynecological Cancers"
- **Professor Chen Xiaohua**, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences - "Mental Health Research Specific to Women's Needs"
- **Dr. Lily Wong**, Harvard Medical School - "Innovative Approaches to Menopause Management"

## Key Research Statistics

Our symposium will address critical research gaps in women's health:

- According to data from China Engineering Academy, infertility rates in China have risen from 12% to 18% between 2007 and 2020
- Approximately 15-25% of new mothers in China experience postpartum depression
- Around 40% of Chinese women suffer from reproductive tract infections and gynecological diseases
- Women are consistently underrepresented in clinical trials across multiple disease areas
- Research on conditions specifically affecting women receives disproportionately less funding worldwide

## Program Highlights

The two-day symposium will feature:

**Day 1: Research Presentations**
- Keynote addresses from leading researchers
- Panel discussions on emerging research areas
- Poster presentations from early-career scientists
- Networking sessions to foster new collaborations

**Day 2: Applied Innovation**
- Research-to-market pathways for women's health innovations
- Case studies of successful research commercialization
- Workshops on securing research funding
- Collaborative sessions between researchers and industry professionals

## Call for Abstracts

We invite researchers, clinicians, and innovators to submit abstracts for consideration in our poster presentation sessions. Submissions should address one of the symposium's key themes and demonstrate scientific rigor and innovation.

**Abstract Submission Deadline**: August 31, 2024
