## Calling All Women's Health Startups!

Are you building an innovative solution in the women's health technology space? FemTech Weekend is excited to announce our inaugural **FemTech Startup Pitch Competition**, designed to connect promising startups with global investors and accelerate the growth of the women's health innovation ecosystem.

## Bridge to Global Markets

As a developer who has worked with multiple health tech startups, I've seen firsthand how challenging it can be for innovative companies to secure funding and global partnerships, especially when focusing on women's health solutions. This pitch competition serves as a crucial bridge between Chinese innovators and the global market.

FemTech Weekend is rooted in China but connects globally. We pioneer women's health innovation in China to drive worldwide impact, creating pathways for visionary founders to showcase their solutions to an international audience.

## Competition Benefits

Selected startups will have the opportunity to:

- **Pitch to International Investors**: Present your solution to a curated group of VCs, angel investors, and corporate partners focused on women's health innovation
- **Gain Global Visibility**: Showcase your company to international media and industry leaders
- **Access Mentorship**: Receive guidance from successful entrepreneurs and industry experts
- **Win Funding**: Compete for equity-free cash prizes and potential investment opportunities

3. **Mental Health Innovations**: Solutions addressing anxiety, depression, stress management
4. **Health Education & Access**: Platforms improving women's health knowledge and care delivery
5. **Workplace Wellness**: Technologies supporting women's health in professional environments

## Event Format

## Judging Panel

Our distinguished panel of judges includes:

- **Michelle Li**, Head of Partnerships at FemTech Weekend and private equity investment expert
- **Dr. Zhang Wei**, Managing Partner at Health Innovation Capital
- **Sarah Chen**, Co-founder of Beyond The Billion
- **Lisa Mou**, Director of Innovation at Women's Hospital of Fudan University
- **Tom Jenkins**, Partner at Sequoia Capital China

## Why FemTech Matters Now

The women's health technology market represents a massive opportunity:
- The global FemTech market is projected to reach $60 billion by 2027
- Women make 80% of healthcare decisions worldwide
- In China, women control over Â¥10 trillion in annual consumer spending

Yet despite these numbers, only a small percentage of healthcare research and innovation specifically addresses women's health challenges. At FemTech Weekend, we're working to change this by amplifying women in tech entrepreneurship and creating an inclusive ecosystem.
