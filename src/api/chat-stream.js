- Social expectations to excel professionally while maintaining traditional family roles
- Limited time for personal health management despite being family health decision-makers

### Workplace Health Challenges:
- **70%+** of working women report high stress levels
- Long working hours (996 culture) impacting health
- Lack of workplace support for women's health needs
- Limited maternity and family care policies
- Gender pay gap affecting health investment capacity

### Healthcare Access Barriers:
- Urban-rural disparities in healthcare quality
- Shortage of specialized women's health providers
- Limited insurance coverage for preventive care
- High out-of-pocket costs for advanced treatments
- Geographic concentration of quality care in tier-1 cities
