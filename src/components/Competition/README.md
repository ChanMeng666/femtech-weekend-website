## Data Management

All static data is managed in `src/data/competition.ts`:

- **competitionStats**: Array of statistics with values and labels
- **timelineEvents**: Timeline events with dates, descriptions, and status
- **prizes**: Prize information including benefits and highlighting
- **specialAwards**: List of special award categories
- **competitionCategories**: Competition focus areas
- **eligibilityCriteria**: Participation requirements

## Styling

Components use:
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Shadcn/ui components** for consistent design
- **Responsive design** for mobile-first approach
- **CSS custom properties** for theme integration

## Customization

### Modifying Data
Update `src/data/competition.ts` to change:
- Statistics values
- Timeline dates and descriptions
- Prize amounts and benefits
- Categories and requirements

### Styling Changes
- Use Tailwind utility classes
- Follow existing design patterns
- Maintain responsive behavior
- Keep accessibility in mind

### Adding New Components
1. Create new component file in this directory
2. Export from `index.ts`
3. Import and use in the main page
4. Add any new data to `competition.ts`

## Best Practices

- ‚úÖ Keep components focused on single responsibility
- ‚úÖ Use TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- ‚úÖ Follow existing naming conventions
- ‚úÖ Maintain responsive design
- ‚úÖ Add proper accessibility attributes
- ‚úÖ Use semantic HTML elements

## Dependencies

- React
- @docusaurus/Link
- ../ui/card (Shadcn/ui)
- ../ui/button (Shadcn/ui)

This modular approach ensures maintainability, reusability, and clear separation of concerns.
