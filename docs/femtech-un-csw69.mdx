# FTW x UN Women CSW69 | They Brought Disruptive FemTech Solutions to the International Stage at Columbia University SIPA!

In 2025, on the 30th anniversary of UN Women's Beijing Declaration, the global focus on technology and gender equality converged in New York. During CSW69 (Commission on the Status of Women) centered on "Women's Leadership," FemTech Weekend presented a special hackathon, declaring to the world: women's health is not a marginal issue, but the next blue ocean for technological innovation.

FemTech Weekend founder Zhu Yihan attended the UN Women CSW69 conference and Columbia University's Technology and Women's Health Innovation Conference, carrying the expectations of hackathon winning teams, FemTech innovation teams, and many women, using technological innovation to advance women's health future. This was not just an international voice but a technological mission concerning women's welfare.

## They Use AI and Innovative Technology to Bridge the "Data Gap" in Workplace Women's Health

### FEMTECH WEEKEND

What are the boundaries of innovation when technology meets women's health?

This hackathon provided the answer—no longer limited to iterating health monitoring tools, but directly addressing core workplace contradictions: how can companies truly prioritize women's health in management?

The participating teams stepped out of traditional frameworks, challenging deeper propositions: designing quantifiable "Health KPI" systems to transform women's health from slogans to executable, trackable workplace metrics. This isn't just technological innovation but an experiment in workplace culture transformation.

Our winning teams showcased these groundbreaking solutions via remote connection on the international stage at Columbia University. The response was enthusiastic, attracting attention from technical executives and HR directors from major corporations like IBM and JP Morgan, officials from UNESCO, and high-ranking international organization officials including the Minister of Gender and Children's Affairs from Sierra Leone.

### Champion Team: MinCo.ai

MinCo.ai: Your mind's copilot - An innovative team providing digital assistant solutions for neurodivergent women

**Innovations:**

✔️ Dynamic Health Risk Assessment System: Integrates anonymously submitted data from female employees including menstrual cycles, fatigue indices, and mental health data (such as stress levels), generating real-time health dashboards to prompt employers to adjust work arrangements

✔️ "Health KPI" Algorithm: Automatically correlates health data with productivity metrics (such as task completion efficiency, leave rates), allowing companies to intuitively see the positive correlation curve between "employee health investment vs. performance returns"

✔️ Team presentation highlight: "If women cannot control their own health data, how can we talk about equality?"

**On-site Response:**

✔️ IBM's HR Director marveled: "Using data to prove healthy employees = efficient teams means companies investing in women's health is no longer charity but a strategic investment."

✔️ UN Women official evaluation: "Not just empty talk about 'equality,' but solving specific scenarios. Using technology to transform the 'right to care' from the Beijing Declaration into executable business language."

### Outstanding Developer: Chan Meng

Chan: Minimalist architect × Full-stack independent developer - When Less is More meets women's technological power

**Innovations:**

✔️ Breaking silence with AI: AI health assistant "Sani" provides personalized health advice for each female employee (e.g., "Current hormone levels suggest reducing meeting duration"), making technological care tangible

✔️ Privacy-first infrastructure: Privacy protection design eliminates employee concerns about data sharing, completing health analysis without accessing raw data

✔️ Dual-perspective data dashboard system:
- Employee side: Visualizes health trends, self-manages data permissions
- HR side: Anonymously aggregates health indicators, generates "Enterprise Women's Health KPIs" (e.g., 23% decrease in menstrual leave rates)

**On-site Response:**

✔️ IBM representative proposed immediate pilot cooperation: "This system is more precise than the million-dollar DEI training we do annually. We believe every socially responsible company will need an AI-driven, data-visualized workplace women's health management platform to truly achieve a technological closed loop from personal health management to corporate humanistic care."

✔️ Sierra Leone's Minister of Gender and Children's Affairs evaluation: "This is the first platform I've seen that implements the full process from menstrual cycle data → AI analysis → actionable health policy recommendations for enterprises."

## Technology, Gender Health Gap, and Corporate Culture Roundtable Discussion

### FEMTECH WEEKEND

FemTech Weekend participated in roundtable discussions, pointing directly to industry pain points—why does women's health technology (FemTech) account for only 3% of global healthcare investment?

**Cecile Delcuvellerie, Inclusive Research Economist from Yale University:**
"Economic models ignore 'menstrual productivity loss,' causing companies to underestimate FemTech value. We are using AI to quantify this invisible cost."

**Rashmi Joshi, Founder of Asha AI:**
"Women represent less than 30% of existing health AI training data. We're launching '100,000 Women's Health Data Crowdsourcing' to reject algorithmic discrimination!"

**Rośan Ndebumadu, Founder of Digital Health Therapeutics:**
"From postpartum depression AI screening to early diagnosis of endometriosis, women's health software isn't a 'niche market,' but an 'essential market'!"

**Chaste Inegbedion, Chief Menstrual Officer (CPO) of Sanile Cloud:**
"True inclusive transformation begins when tech company executives start discussing 'menstrual leave algorithms'."

**Zhu Yihan, Founder of FemTech Weekend:**
"We don't want vague 'care,' but health rights that can prove their value through data and technology."

## New "Beijing+30 Action Agenda" - Technology for Good, Women's Power

### FEMTECH WEEKEND

In the UN Women's global dialogue on the 30th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration, "technology empowering women" is no longer just a slogan but a revolution in progress.

The newly released "Beijing+30 Action Agenda" clearly states:

"Close the digital gender divide, ensure women and girls can lead the digital and artificial intelligence revolution, while preventing technology-facilitated gender violence, privacy violations, and algorithmic bias."

This goal aligns perfectly with China's recently published "Measures to Support Women in Science and Technology to Play a Greater Role in Scientific and Technological Innovation."

## Future Prospects

### FEMTECH WEEKEND

Globally, the women's health technology (FemTech) market is flourishing at an unprecedented pace. According to McKinsey and FemTech Analytics forecasts, the global FemTech market is expected to soar to $97.3 billion by 2030.

In China, this field harbors enormous potential and limitless possibilities. Looking toward 2025 and beyond, we firmly believe FemTech will bring even more positive impacts. Technological innovation in women's health is not only a technological breakthrough but also a manifestation of social progress.

This emerging blue ocean market awaits our exploration, mining, and innovation. Let's move forward together, creating a healthier, more equal, and more vibrant world in the era of technology and AI!
