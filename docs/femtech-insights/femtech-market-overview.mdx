## 02 Industry Trends

### Part 1: Macro Environment

#### 01 Investment Environment

Ida Liu, Global Head of Citi Private Bank, predicted in an interview with Bloomberg: Over the next five years, women will control more than 50% of global wealth.

Female investors generally value sustainability, social impact, and long-term value, which are becoming key factors guiding the flow of trillions of dollars. Wealth is increasingly being directed toward businesses that prioritize human and planetary well-being.

Impact investing, ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investing, and capital allocation guided by these goals are gradually shaping the new normal in the investment landscape.

#### 02 Investment Opportunities

2025 is set to be a pivotal turning point for funding in female health technology (FemTech). Venture capitalists and institutional investors have finally recognized that women's health represents a vast and underdeveloped market. From menopause management to endometriosis treatment, these previously underfunded areas are now attracting billions in investments, driving unprecedented innovation.

According to Pitchbook data, in 2024, the total venture capital in the European FemTech sector reached â‚¬339 million across 47 deals. This figure not only exceeds the 2021 high of â‚¬325 million but also marks a substantial growth in the industry.

However, with the influx of significant funding, market expectations have also risen. Investors will increasingly focus on data-driven outcomes, while consumers will expect products to deliver tangible and specific benefits.

### Part 2: Women's Health Subsectors

#### 01 Menopause Care: Moving Toward Mainstream

As global populations age, innovations related to menopause and aging become increasingly crucial. Menopause has transformed from a marginal topic to a field garnering significant attention, attracting interest from startups to industry leaders. They offer solutions covering everything from symptom management to long-term health maintenance, aimed at helping women navigate this challenging life stage smoothly.

However, the rising popularity of menopause brings potential risks. Some brands use menopause as a trendy label to package products and services lacking substantial efficacy or clinical validation. This approach not only misleads consumers but may also negatively impact the credibility of the entire industry.

Therefore, 2025 is expected to see the establishment of close collaborations between academia, research institutions, and startups to accelerate the transformation of scientific findings into actual technologies and products to enhance overall progress in the menopause field.

#### 02 Menstrual Health Innovation: Redefining Period Care

Innovations in menstrual health are addressing long-standing issues such as dysmenorrhea, irregular menstrual cycles, and the lack of sustainable period products.

By 2025, menstrual health innovations are expected to move beyond simple tracking to achieve true health optimization. These innovations will help women understand their bodies more deeply and make more informed health decisions. Menstrual data will become a new window for clinicians to understand women's health conditions, enabling early identification and intervention for conditions like anemia and thyroid disease.

#### 03 Sexual Health: An Increasingly Prominent Priority

Sexual health is a key component of overall well-being but is often overlooked in healthcare. FemTech is breaking this limitation by focusing on products and services related to sexual health, pleasure, and function. Sexual health concerns not only women's physical well-being but also psychological and emotional aspects.

Telemedicine platforms provide privacy-protected consultations for sexual health, while innovative products like wearable devices and pelvic floor muscle trainers help women address issues such as painful intercourse and sexual satisfaction. The development of applications and educational tools is also promoting open discussions about sexual health topics.

By 2025, FemTech solutions will help normalize sexual health conversations, reduce stigma, and provide more accessible care options, ensuring women receive the necessary support throughout all life stages.

#### 04 Reproductive Health: Automated Technology Leading the Reproductive Revolution

As a core area of FemTech, reproductive health is expected to significantly expand its service scope and accessibility by 2025. Fertility preservation, once viewed as a premium service, is gradually becoming mainstream with technological advancements and increased workplace support.

Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART), such as In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) and Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI), has greatly improved fertility success rates. Startups will enhance the efficiency of fertility treatments by automating these processes and optimizing laboratory procedures for fertility preservation, including egg, sperm, and embryo freezing. Fertility automation technology will strengthen reproductive health management through precise fertility tracking and prediction, helping individuals and couples make positive progress in their fertility journey.

### Part 3: Technology Applications

#### 01 Agentic AI: Smarter Decision Support in Women's Health

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has already triggered a transformation in healthcare, and by 2025, we expect to see the rise of Agentic AIâ€”systems capable of operating autonomously within set parameters.

Unlike traditional AI, Agentic AI no longer relies on human intervention; it can analyze data, generate recommendations, and even assist in clinical decision-making.

Imagine when a pregnant woman's wearable device detects abnormal heart rate and blood pressure, Agentic AI can immediately analyze this data, compare it with millions of cases, and quickly provide recommendations to healthcare providers. These systems can also help identify early signs of breast cancer, optimize fertility treatment, and manage chronic conditions like osteoporosis.

The complexity of women's health issues often leads to diagnostic errors or delayed interventions. Agentic AI reduces these risks by providing clinicians with precise, evidence-based analyses. By 2025, through integration with diagnostic tools, wearable devices, and telemedicine platforms, Agentic AI will make healthcare services more proactive, predictive, and personalized.

#### 02 AI-Driven Diagnostic Platforms and Cutting-Edge Imaging Technologies

Women often face long waiting periods in the diagnostic process, especially in areas such as autoimmune diseases and gynecological disorders, where symptoms are frequently overlooked or misunderstood. The new generation of FemTech is working to change this situation.

AI-driven diagnostic platforms and advanced imaging technologies are shortening diagnostic times. AI-enhanced ultrasound can more precisely identify abnormalities, while home test kits enable women to collect data without going to hospitals. These tools simplify the diagnostic process, helping healthcare providers make quick and accurate decisions.

Rapid diagnosis can save lives. By 2025, solutions that reduce diagnostic delays will improve treatment effectiveness and lessen the burden on healthcare systems. In resource-constrained communities, these tools are particularly important as they make women's care more universal and equitable.

#### 03 Digital Therapeutics: Medical Innovation Beyond Apps

Digital therapeutics are leading the transformation from passive health monitoring to active treatment. Doctors can now prescribe software-driven interventions combined with traditional treatments to treat and manage diseases.

For example, digital therapeutics provide cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) courses through applications, offering mental health support for new mothers with postpartum depression; or using virtual reality to alleviate chronic pelvic pain. These tools extend healthcare services beyond clinics, meeting women's practical needs.

In the face of strained medical resources, digital therapeutics offer a cost-effective solution. By 2025, their application in women's health will further expand, filling care gaps and empowering women with greater health autonomy.

## 03 Looking Ahead to 2025

In 2025, the FemTech industry is expected to maintain strong growth momentum. Investment and innovation will be the two core forces driving the development of the FemTech industry, offering more convenient and personalized care services to address the systemic disparities women face in healthcare.

The development of the FemTech industry will not only promote women's health but also drive broader social and economic benefits, achieving more profound social and economic progress.
