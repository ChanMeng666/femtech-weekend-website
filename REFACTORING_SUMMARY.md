# Competition Page Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The `competition.tsx` file has been refactored to improve code maintainability, scalability, and project structure clarity. The monolithic component has been broken down into smaller, reusable components with proper separation of concerns.

## New Structure

### 📁 Components (`src/components/Competition/`)
The competition page has been divided into the following modular components:

1. **`CompetitionHero.tsx`** - Hero section with title, description, and CTA buttons
2. **`CompetitionStats.tsx`** - Statistics display (participating teams, prize pool, etc.)
3. **`Timeline.tsx`** - Competition timeline with phases and dates
4. **`Prizes.tsx`** - Prize information and special awards
5. **`Requirements.tsx`** - Competition categories and eligibility criteria
6. **`RegistrationCTA.tsx`** - Registration call-to-action section
7. **`index.ts`** - Barrel export for all competition components

### 📁 Data (`src/data/competition.ts`)
All static data has been extracted into a dedicated data file:

- `competitionStats` - Array of competition statistics
- `timelineEvents` - Timeline events with dates and descriptions
- `prizes` - Prize information including benefits
- `specialAwards` - List of special award categories
- `competitionCategories` - Competition focus areas
- `eligibilityCriteria` - Requirements for participation

### 🏗️ Types
TypeScript interfaces have been defined for type safety:

- `CompetitionStat` - Statistics structure
- `TimelineEvent` - Timeline event structure with status
- `Prize` - Prize information structure
- `CompetitionCategory` - Category structure

## Benefits

### ✅ Improved Maintainability
- Each component has a single responsibility
- Easy to locate and modify specific sections
- Clear separation between data and presentation

### ✅ Enhanced Reusability
- Components can be reused in other parts of the application
- Data can be shared across different components
- Consistent TypeScript typing

### ✅ Better Developer Experience
- Smaller, focused files are easier to understand
- Clear import/export structure
- Type safety with TypeScript interfaces

### ✅ Scalability
- Easy to add new competition-related features
- Simple to modify individual components without affecting others
- Data changes are centralized

## Usage

### Importing Components
```tsx
import {
  CompetitionHero,
  CompetitionStats,
  Timeline,
  Prizes,
  Requirements,
  RegistrationCTA
} from '../components/Competition';
```

### Using Data
```tsx
import { competitionStats, timelineEvents } from '../data/competition';
```

### Page Structure
The main `competition.tsx` page now simply orchestrates the components:

```tsx
export default function Competition() {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <main>
        <CompetitionHero />
        <CompetitionStats />
        <Timeline />
        <Prizes />
        <Requirements />
        <RegistrationCTA />
      </main>
    </Layout>
  );
}
```

## File Structure
```

├── components/
│   └── Competition/
│       ├── CompetitionHero.tsx
│       ├── CompetitionStats.tsx
│       ├── Timeline.tsx

│       └── index.ts
├── data/

```

This refactoring establishes a solid foundation for future development and makes the codebase more professional and maintainable.
